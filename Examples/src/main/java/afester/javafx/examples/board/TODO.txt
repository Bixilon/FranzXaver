Missing features
* Add holes into the board (circle of arbitrary radius, or even other objects) 
* Undo/Redo
* Rubberband to select multiple parts
* When converting Airwires to Traces, a better approach would probably be to allow the user to select the
  Segments which shall be converted and then convert them. This is probably better than having all these
  different Interactors.

Bugs
* Synchronize schematic - replace Parts, properly update the UI!!
* Delete segments => sometimes deletes too many or the wrong segment!

* Zoom should zoom the desk, not the paper - consequently the scroll bars should then be resized as well
* Dimension text not properly positioned if styled through the CSS
* Installed font PCBius not available through its name even though it is installed
* When resizing the board, the holes are not properly rendered when e.g. the upper right corner is moved upwards
* "Reset Net" needs to remove all junctions from the net
