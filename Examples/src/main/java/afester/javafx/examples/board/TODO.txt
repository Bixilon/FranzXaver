Missing features
* Add holes into the board (circle of arbitrary radius) 

Bugs
* "Reset Net" needs to remove all junctions from the net
* Select a Part, click and drack another part => the initially selected part is moved instead of the recent one
* Zoom should zoom the desk, not the paper - consequently the scroll bars should then be resized as well
* Dimension text not properly positioned if styled through the CSS
* Installed font PCBius not available through its name even though it is installed
* When resizing the board, the holes are not properly rendered when e.g. the upper right corner is moved upwards
* When adding a board corner, the board should remain convex. Probably we need to calculate the distance to the line connecting two corners.
