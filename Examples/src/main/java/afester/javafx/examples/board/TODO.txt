Missing features
* Add holes into the board (circle of arbitrary radius, or even other objects) 
* Undo/Redo
* Rubberband to select multiple parts

Bugs
* Zoom should zoom the desk, not the paper - consequently the scroll bars should then be resized as well
* Dimension text not properly positioned if styled through the CSS
* Installed font PCBius not available through its name even though it is installed
* When resizing the board, the holes are not properly rendered when e.g. the upper right corner is moved upwards
* "Reset Net" needs to remove all junctions from the net
